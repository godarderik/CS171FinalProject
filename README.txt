Created as a final project for the Harvard University course “CS 171: Visualization”

This is Education Calibration, a website designed to make the daunting college selection process easier for interested high school students and education experts.

The College Mapper page features a choropleth map illustrating the number of colleges in each state. After filtering based on characteristics such as Admissions Rate or Average SAT Score, nodes will show up once less than 200 schools fit the criteria. To take a look at the school more closely, click on the More Information link within the tooltip that pops up after clicking a node. This takes you to the School Visualization page.

The Make Scatterplot page allows users to discover nationwide trends across all schools in America by comparing characteristics such as Average SAT Score and 150% Time Graduation Rate. These data points can be colored according to additional characteristics, such as private vs public. To take a look at the school more closely, click on the dot to visit the School Visualization page.

The School Visualization page allows users to see data about either one or two colleges in the form of a data table and pie charts or side-by-side segmented bar charts. This allows users to compare any two colleges on important metrics such as college student body make-ups and tuition break-downs.
